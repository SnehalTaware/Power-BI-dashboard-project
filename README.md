I just created my first sales analysis dashboard using PowerBI.

The dashboard includes key performance indicators such as Total Profit, Total Sales, quantity, and shipping cost order as well as a breakdown of sales by segment, category, and Country.

I am eager to continue learning and exploring the capabilities of Power BI.
